# Academy of Human Resource Development Special Interest Group Charter: Health Professions Education (HPE)

AHRD was formed to “encourage systematic study of HRD theories, processes, and practices; to disseminate information about HRD, to encourage the application of HRD research findings, and to provide opportunities for social interaction among individuals with scholarly and professional interests in HRD from multiple disciplines and from across the globe” (www.ahrd.org). The Academy’s vision is “leading the profession through research.”

Formation of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) is a mechanism to foster scholarship, dissemination of information, and fellowship among persons of similar academic and/or professional interests.
