## Note
### Motivation
- Bibliometrics approach without a specific research frame is meaningless
- If we can successfully show the identification and boundary of HPE from a conceptual literature review, the following questions would be beneficial to the bibliometrics approach
- Comparision disciplinary between research in HPE and HRD (or specific area of HRD, i.e., learning and development)
    - What is the similarity and what is the difference between the two discipline
    - Are they enough to have disciplinary for comparison?
    - What mature level are those two disciplines' area
    - exploring knowledge expansion by identifying similarities and difference
    - What different or similar(standard) academic root and path between two types of research


### Advantage
- Providing map-like information and knowledge for researchers and practitioners
- Bibliometrics approaches allow researchers to compare two different disciplinaries
- Diverse level of comparison
    - research front (co-citation)
    - research backend (biblio-coupling)
    - keyword level (keyword network)
    - topic model (timely evolved trend)

### Shortage (struggle)
- Without specific boundaries and theoritical reasoning, useless
